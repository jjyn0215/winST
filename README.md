# winST
A simple windows app for SmartThings which can control devcices

## Why did you make this?
I'm new at C# ( I'm not a professional even ) btw my college wanted me to make a project

However official ST application has some lack of function so I tried to make a new one using
[MaterialSkin2](https://github.com/leocb/MaterialSkin) Lib

## Functions
- Basic device on/off
- Make a shortcut keys to control devices in background
- Allows to show location status
- Multiple tokens can be used by logining and It's locally saved

## How to use
#### 1. Sign up and Login
#### 2. Set SmartThings API Token at settings page
> If you don't have ST Token, you can get [HERE](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)

> It will load your devices at devices page however this takes some time depending on your Internet quailty ( less than a minute )
#### 3. To make a shortcut, click a label of device that you want. Maximum combination is 3. This will trigger anytime.
    
## Todo
1. Sensor status display
2. Make load faster, but **HOW?** (caching?)
3. More device support
4. More language support
5. Need to fix some terrible codes
6. Convert to WPF application?

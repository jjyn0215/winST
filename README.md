# winST
A simple device controller for SmartThings

# Why did you make this?
I'm new at C# ( I'm not a professional even ) btw my college wanted me to make a project

However official ST application is quite useless so I tried to make a new one with
[MaterialSkin2](https://github.com/leocb/MaterialSkin) lib

# Functions
- Basic device on/off
- Make a shortcut to control devices in background
- Allows to show location status
- Multiple keys can be used by logining and It's locally saved

# How to use
#### 1. Sign up and Login
#### 2. Set SmartThings API Token at settings page
> If you don't have ST Token, you can get [HERE](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)

> It will load your devices at devices page however this takes some time depending on your Internet quailty ( less than a minute )
#### 3. To make a shortcut, click a label of device that you want. Maximum combination is 3. This will trigger anytime.
    
# Todo
1. Sensor status display
2. Make load faster, but **HOW?**
3. More device support
4. More language support
5. Convert to WPF application?

# winST
A simple device controller for SmartThings


![Sample](https://github.com/jjyn0215/winST/blob/main/sample.png?raw=true)
# Why did you make this?
I'm new at C# ( I'm not a professional even ) btw my college wanted me to make a project

However official ST application is quite useless so I tried to make a new one with
[MaterialSkin2](https://github.com/leocb/MaterialSkin) made by lecob


# Functions
1. Basic device on/off
2. Make a shortcut to control devices in background
3. Login but is it useful?


# Todo
1. Sensor status display
2. More device support
3. More language support
4. Convert to WPF application
